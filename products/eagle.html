            <h2>Eagle I</h2>
            <p>Eagle I was a rocket built using PVC pipe as the primary structure, representing a straightforward yet innovative design approach. 
            It flew on Flight 1 and 2. Unfortunately, its journey came to an abrupt end when it was destroyed by a crash, marking the conclusion of its 
            short-lived but significant role in the Eagle Program.</p>

            <h2>Eagle 1.5</h2>
            <p>Eagle 1.5 took to the skies during the third flight, showcasing a thruster configuration that distinguished it from previous iterations. 
            Following its successful mission, the rocket was retired and generously gifted to a student, serving as a keepsake and a symbol of inspiration 
            for future aerospace endeavors.</p>

            <h2>Eagle II</h2>
            <p>Eagle II represents the next generation of our model rocket design, featuring fully 3D-printed construction. This advanced rocket was designed 
            and manufactured for Central using the state-of-the-art Combat Printer Hardware (CPH), showcasing the capabilities of modern 3D printing technology. 
            Eagle II is set to make its debut test flight, marking an exciting milestone in our pursuit of innovation and progress.</p>
